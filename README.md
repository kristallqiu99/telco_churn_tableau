## Features
- **Churn Overview**: A high-level view of the overall churn rate within the company, offering a quick snapshot of customer retention health.
- **Customer Distribution by Payment Method**: Insight into how different payment methods may correlate with churn rates, providing actionable insights for payment process optimization.
- **Churn by Gender**: Analysis of churn rates across different gender groups to understand if there are any significant disparities and to tailor gender-specific retention strategies.
- **Customer Contracts Analysis**: Visualization of customer distribution by contract type (month-to-month, one year, two years) and its impact on churn, offering a strategic view on contract management.
- **Churn by Dependents**: Examination of churn rates among customers with and without dependents to identify if family obligations influence retention.
- **Customer Tenure Analysis**: Assessment of how customer loyalty (tenure) impacts churn, potentially identifying at-risk customer segments based on their duration with the company.
- **Total Charges by Churn**: A comparative visualization of the total charges incurred by customers who have churned versus those who have not, highlighting any patterns in revenue impact due to churn.
